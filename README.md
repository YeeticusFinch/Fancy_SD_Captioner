(ignore the bad captions lol)

## Instructions

Download the appropriate zip file from the '`eleases` tab
Extract the zip file
Run the executable
A folder selector should pop up, select the folder containing the images and text files
- Text files and images should be in the same folder, and the text files should share the same names as their corresponding images
The images will then be displayed adjacent to the contents of their corresponding text files
Use the scroll wheel to scroll through all the images and captions
You can edit the captions directly, and it will automatically save to the appropriate text files (writes to the file if no key is pressed for 0.4 seconds)
Hover your mouse over the image thumbnail to see a larger preview
